# Customizable (Multi-) Day Pillbox

## Introduction

A multi-day pill organizer / pillbox.

Provides multiple days with multiple chambers each.

The number of chambers per day and the number of days are easily customizable in the provided OpenSCAD files. As are the
dimensions of each chamber, the labelling of the days, and the labelling of the chambers.

Each chamber has a sloped southern edge to aid in sliding out the pills.

## Ready-to-Print Instructions (Prusa MINI)

For the Prusa MINI with PLA filament, ready-to-print GCODE files of the pillbox body are provided in six variants:

- Pillbox de 7x2: German labels, 7 days, 2 chambers per day (morning and evening).
- Pillbox de 7x4: German labels, 7 days, 4 chambers per day (morning, noon, evening, and night). Each individual chamber
  is a little shorter than in the 7x2 version.
- Pillbox en_GB 7x2: English labels, week starts on Monday, 7 days, 2 chambers per day (morning and evening).
- Pillbox en_GB 7x4: English labels, week starts on Monday, 7 days, 4 chambers per day (morning, noon, evening, and
  night). Each individual chamber is a little shorter than in the 7x2 version.
- Pillbox en_US 7x2: English labels, week starts on Sunday, 7 days, 2 chambers per day (morning and evening).
- Pillbox en_US 7x4: English labels, week starts on Sunday, 7 days, 4 chambers per day (morning, noon, evening, and
  night). Each individual chamber is a little shorter than in the 7x2 version.

The lid is provided in two variants:

- Pillbox Lid x2: 2 chambers per day (morning and evening).
- Pillbox Lid x4: 4 chambers per day (morning, noon, evening, and night). Each individual chamber is a little shorter
  than in the 7x2 version.

The fit of the lids is fairly tight. You might need to grab a small flathead screwdriver or a paper clip to clean out
the lid channels after printing.

## Ready-to-Slice Instructions (all other printers)

For all other printers or filaments, ready-to-slice STL files are provided in the same variants as above.

## Customization Instructions

If none of the pre-compiled files suit your needs, edit the OpenSCAD file of the variant that comes closest to your
needs. Further instructions are given in the file itself.

## Other Uses

The box can easily be customized to better suit other uses. For example, why not increase the chamber dimensions, reduce
the chamber count, remove the labels, and then use the box to store boardgame pieces?

The primary functional changes are (a) the addition of a sloped edge to each chamber, which makes it easier to slide out
the pills; and (b) easier customization of the chamber dimensions. To facilitate both, the OpenSCAD files have been
completely rewritten.
